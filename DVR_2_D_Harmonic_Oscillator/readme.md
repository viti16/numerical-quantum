This is application of DVR method to solve for eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a particle in 2-D harmnic oscillator.
It is written in Fortran and can be executed using:
> gfortran dvr2dho.f95
> ./a.out
to print the first 4 eigenvalues, HO potential in space and first 4 eigenvectors along the x,y axis.
